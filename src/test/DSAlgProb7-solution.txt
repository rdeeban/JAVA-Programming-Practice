How is an integer array sorted in place using the quicksort algorithm?

The quicksort algorithm sorts an integer array by first partitioning the array into two subarrays.
It then sorts the two subarrays using recursive calls to quicksort.
Because the two subarrays are sorted, the entire array is now sorted.
Quicksort is in place because constant memory is required to sort the array.
